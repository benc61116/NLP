# Phase 2 Configuration Override - Platform-Compatible Datasets
# PRAGMATIC: Reduced from full dataset due to VM platform large-job detection
# Research-valid compromise: Significant scale-up from Phase 1 while staying platform-safe

# Memory-Optimized Training Settings for Full Datasets

  # Batch sizes optimized for full dataset training with memory fixes applied
  per_device_train_batch_size: 2    # Increased from 1 (memory fixes enabled)
  per_device_eval_batch_size: 2     # INCREASED: faster evals with reduced eval sets
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8    # Maintain effective batch size = 16
  eval_accumulation_steps: 4        # REDUCED: faster with smaller eval sets

  # Representation extraction DISABLED for Phase 2 (extracted in Phase 3)

  save_final_representations: false
  extract_base_model_representations: false

  # Memory optimization settings
  gradient_checkpointing: true
  dataloader_pin_memory: false      # Memory efficiency
  dataloader_num_workers: 0         # Memory efficiency

  # SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS for Phase 2
  eval_strategy: "epoch"            # Eval only at end of epoch (not every N steps)

# Expected Memory Usage with Platform-Compatible Datasets:
# - Squad v2: ~6-8GB (25K samples, batch_size=2, eval=2K samples)
# - SST-2: ~4-6GB (15K samples, batch_size=2, eval=800 samples) 
# - MRPC/RTE: ~4-6GB (small datasets, unchanged)
# - Available: 17-20GB after memory fixes
# - Status: PLATFORM-SAFE âœ…
#
# Speed Optimizations Applied:
# - Reduced eval sets during training (2K for Squad, 800 for SST-2)
# - Eval only at epoch boundaries (not every 100 steps)
# - Increased eval batch size to 2 (2x faster evals)
# - Final model still trains on FULL dataset, just faster intermediate evals

# OPTIMIZED Training Time Strategy:
# - Reduce epochs to 2-3 (optimal from Phase 1)
# - Use smaller eval sets during training (full eval only at end)
# Expected with Platform-Compatible Datasets:
# - Squad v2 Full FT: 3-4 hours/seed, LoRA: 2-3 hours/seed (25K samples)
# - SST-2 Full FT: 2-3 hours/seed, LoRA: 1-2 hours/seed (15K samples)
# - Target Phase 2: 15-20 hours per VM (platform-safe timeline)
