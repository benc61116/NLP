# NLP Project

This repository contains NLP experiments and models that are tracked using Weights & Biases (wandb).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure wandb for this project:**
   ```bash
   # Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc)
   export WANDB_PROJECT=NLP
   export WANDB_ENTITY=galavny-tel-aviv-university
   
   # Then reload your shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Login to wandb:**
   ```bash
   wandb login
   ```

4. **Test your setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_wandb_connection.py
   ```

## 📊 Experiment Tracking

All experiments will automatically be logged to: **https://wandb.ai/galavny-tel-aviv-university/NLP**

### In Your Code:
```python
import wandb

# Simple initialization - uses environment variables automatically
wandb.init()

# Your training code here...
wandb.log({"loss": loss, "accuracy": accuracy})

wandb.finish()
```

### Alternative (Explicit Configuration):
```python
import wandb

# Explicit initialization (if environment variables not set)
wandb.init(
    project="NLP",
    entity="galavny-tel-aviv-university"
)
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables

The project relies on these environment variables being set:
- `WANDB_PROJECT=NLP` - Routes experiments to the NLP project
- `WANDB_ENTITY=galavny-tel-aviv-university` - Sets the organization

**Note:** These should be added to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence across sessions.

## 🤝 For Collaborators

If you're new to this project:

1. **Fork/Clone** this repository
2. **Set environment variables** as shown in Quick Start step 2
3. **Install dependencies** with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Login to wandb** with your account (you'll need access to the `galavny-tel-aviv-university` organization)
5. **Test your setup** with `python test_wandb_connection.py`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- **Not seeing experiments in wandb?** Check your environment variables with `echo $WANDB_PROJECT`
- **Permission denied?** Make sure you have access to the `galavny-tel-aviv-university` organization
- **Connection issues?** Run the test script: `python test_wandb_connection.py`
